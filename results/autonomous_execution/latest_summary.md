# Autonomous Execution Summary

Updated: 2026-07-26T23:24:34Z

The resumable 18-phase ledger was initialized from verified Batch 3 state.
Batch 3 and Phases 1–3 are checkpointed locally; Phase 4 has passed its gate
and is awaiting its local checkpoint.

Current status: Phase 1 passed and was checkpointed locally at
`5268df37a39ba443fdf26ee15dc0a09d3bcb59ae`.

Phase 1 validation:

- Focused tests: 108 passed (3 deprecation warnings)
- Full suite: 365 passed (34 warnings)
- Ruff and `git diff --check`: passed
- Canonical integration smoke: 288 candidates deterministically regenerated;
  286 rejected as measured and 2 as source-identical; zero accepted
- Artifact hashes: validated

The zero-accepted smoke result is retained as a scientifically relevant
property of the densely crossed canonical HTE subset. Separate focused tests
exercise valid accepted candidates, chemical duplicates, and feature
collisions.

Current status: Phase 2 passed and was checkpointed locally at
`4c9f9c7497d0cc19927a3689841de91b5525d0ca`.

Phase 2 validation:

- Focused tests: 77 passed (1 pandas warning)
- Full suite: 384 passed (35 warnings)
- Ruff and `git diff --check`: passed
- Canonical integration smoke: strict anonymous transfer correctly produced
  zero candidates because catalyst is invariant; strict typed `reject` produced
  zero; declared typed `random` fallback produced 2 auditable candidates
- Exact all/any role diffs, no-unrequested-change assertions, and single-step
  fallback behavior are covered in shared and runner-level regression tests
- Artifact hashes: validated

Scientific limitation: a strict anonymous full-condition policy cannot operate
on this canonical HTE subset while catalyst is a requested invariant role. This
is retained as a null eligibility result, not converted into a hidden fallback.

Current status: Phase 3 passed and was checkpointed locally at
`1bbfa0ebd08f514e2e1844687f944f3c46352adb`.

Phase 3 validation:

- Focused tests: 131 passed (5 warnings)
- Full suite: 414 passed (35 warnings)
- Ruff and `git diff --check`: passed
- Canonical integration smoke: 192 proposals, exact maximum of 2 per source,
  input-permutation-invariant audit records, and zero proposals under an
  impossible configured threshold
- Artifact hashes: validated

The dense canonical HTE grid yielded zero accepted chemical candidates after
identity rejection; focused fixtures cover nonempty ranking and selection.
Calibrated uncertainty is deliberately null pending Phase 12, while transparent
deterministic proxy ranks are labeled accordingly. Nonchemical interpolation
and GAN controls report component chemical similarities as null.

Current activity: Phase 4 passed its scientific and engineering gate; its local
Git checkpoint is pending.

Phase 4 validation:

- Focused tests: 85 passed
- Full suite: 442 passed (35 warnings)
- Ruff and `git diff --check`: passed
- Canonical integration smoke: real-only, anonymous, role-aware, and hybrid
  runners loaded seed 0 at 1% training data from the same saved assignments
- All four split-audit CSVs are byte-identical and record aggregate hash
  `cb1d85ab...`, seed hash `3c004950...`, and fixed validation/test ID hashes
- All 44 runner output hashes recorded by the smoke manifest were revalidated

Scientific result: strict anonymous and typed transfer had no eligible nonzero
policy in this dense canonical slice, so the runners recorded exclusions and
did not evaluate augmentation on the outer test. The hybrid completed its
real-only AE control and selected no hybrid policy. This null eligibility result
was not replaced by fallback generation.
