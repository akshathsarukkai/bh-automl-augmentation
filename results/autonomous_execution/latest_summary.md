# Autonomous Execution Summary

Updated: 2026-07-26T22:58:57Z

The resumable 18-phase ledger has been initialized from verified Batch 3 state.
No post–Batch 3 phase has yet passed. The protected worktree contains uncommitted
Batch 3 canonicalization and split work based on commit
`01492f8d0c58a1f3b751e50cd420ee92ad1c60b5`.

Current status: Phase 1 passed and was checkpointed locally at
`5268df37a39ba443fdf26ee15dc0a09d3bcb59ae`.

Phase 1 validation:

- Focused tests: 108 passed (3 deprecation warnings)
- Full suite: 365 passed (34 warnings)
- Ruff and `git diff --check`: passed
- Canonical integration smoke: 288 candidates deterministically regenerated;
  286 rejected as measured and 2 as source-identical; zero accepted
- Artifact hashes: validated

The zero-accepted smoke result is retained as a scientifically relevant
property of the densely crossed canonical HTE subset. Separate focused tests
exercise valid accepted candidates, chemical duplicates, and feature
collisions.

Current activity: Phase 2 passed its scientific and engineering gate; the local
checkpoint commit is pending.

Phase 2 validation:

- Focused tests: 77 passed (1 pandas warning)
- Full suite: 384 passed (35 warnings)
- Ruff and `git diff --check`: passed
- Canonical integration smoke: strict anonymous transfer correctly produced
  zero candidates because catalyst is invariant; strict typed `reject` produced
  zero; declared typed `random` fallback produced 2 auditable candidates
- Exact all/any role diffs, no-unrequested-change assertions, and single-step
  fallback behavior are covered in shared and runner-level regression tests
- Artifact hashes: validated

Scientific limitation: a strict anonymous full-condition policy cannot operate
on this canonical HTE subset while catalyst is a requested invariant role. This
is retained as a null eligibility result, not converted into a hidden fallback.

Canonical dependencies detected:

- `data/processed/bh_canonical_roles_v1.csv`
- `results/corrected_canonical_splits/split_manifest.json`

No external blockers are currently active.
